# Bananas-Discord-Bot
This is the code of my discord bot. There is maybe going to be a little bit of bugs but I hope not too much. It's coded with the datetime library, the discord.py library, the random library, the asyncio library, the json libary and finally a file named config where you put your bot token.
It's creating json files if you don't have them and uses some images that are in the repositorie.
